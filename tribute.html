                Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, Indiaâ€”died April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam),
                 Indian mathematician whose contributions to the theory of numbers include pioneering discoveries 
                 of the properties of the partition function.

                He originally created some of his theories while in India, though when he travelled to Cambridge in England to discuss his 
                mathematical formulas with the brightest minds of the time,he created many there too. It was in England that Ramanujan began an inspirational partnership with the Cambridge professor 
                 Godfrey Harold Hardy. Professor Hardy realised that Ramanujan had discovered certain mathematical formulas by
                  himself that were actually already known to the mathematical elite. However, what was more striking was that
                   he created his own formulas, which warranted further understanding. Most of his theories have been proven 
                   correct over time and have provided mathematicians since then with the basis
                    from which to create formulas that continue to shape science today.
